The primary datasets are:
- _ExpPatch_PhotoCounts.csv_ -- Quadrat-specific times-series of species abundances.
- _ExpPatch_IntxnStr.csv_ -- Patch-specific time-series of calculated prey-specific feeding rates ("frate").

The secondary datasets are:
- _ExpPatch_PatchTidalHeights.csv_ -- Average vertical distance (in cm) of each Patch (A-G, AB-AF) from Mean Lower Low Water level (MLLW).
- _ExpPatch_QuadLocations.csv_ -- The horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) position of each quadrat's upper-left and bottom-right bolts within each patch.
- _ExpPatch_SpeciesTypesIDs.txt_ -- The ID and name of the 27 species "types".
- _ExpPatch_TempsCleaned.csv_ -- Temperature data from TidBit data-loggers.

The files for these datasets should not be altered or modified.  That's why they're in this "original" data sub-directory.  Derived datasets should not be placed into this directory.
